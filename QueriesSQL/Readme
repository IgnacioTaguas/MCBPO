  - URI, name and ID for a protein accession number
  - URI and name for a gene/species/subcellular location/biological function/biological process ID
  - What class of protein does a given protein belong to?
  - What gene codifies for a given protein?
  - Which are the cellular locations of a given protein?
  - Which are the biological functions that a given protein carries out?
  - Which are the biological proceses in which a given protein is involved?
  - What is the length and unit of measure of a given protein?
  - Which proteins are coded by a given gene?
  - Which proteins appear in a given cellular location?
  - Which proteins have a given biological function?
  - Which proteins are involved in a given biological process?
  - Which proteins have the same name as a given protein?
  - Which genes have the same name as a given gene?
  - Which cellular locations are shared by two given proteins?
